Well Done, you seem to have used a \*nix system before, now try something more serious.
Please don't post writeups, solutions or spoilers about the games on the web. Thank you!)

# NOTE TO Team OverTheWire 

To OverTheWire team,

I agree that posting solutions online takes away the fun of CTF, but what I believe is that if someone really needs help, we ought to. If a person just searches for the solution without any personal effort, I guess they were never meant to play CTF at all... or even be involved in cybersecurity. For those who want to learn, writeups are a good source to understand where they were going wrong.
